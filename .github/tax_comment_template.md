:sparkles: Wow! You're here! :sparkles:

We are so glad you're ready to jump into SQ Bounties! Giving us your address here is the perfect first step! There are a couple other things you should do, as well! At least, if you want to get paid.

- **Submit your tax and KYC information.** If you haven't already, this should be done by signing up on the [Stellar Quest website](https://quest.stellar.org). I know it feels like a hassle, but SQ Bounties can be lucrative and SDF needs to make sure all our ducks are in a row.

- **Join our Discord.** It's the friendliest community in crypto! Especially if you want to do some code reviews around here, we do need to know a bit about you, and have some interactions with you. So, come on by and get to know us on the official [Stellar Quest discord server](https://discord.gg/jDjSQvTHTC)

Once you've done those, please comment below to let us know that you're ready to go! Thanks again for joining us. We're so glad to have you on board.
