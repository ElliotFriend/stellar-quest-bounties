:sparkles: Wow! You're here! :sparkles:

We are so glad you're ready to jump into SQ Bounties! Giving us your address
here is the perfect first step! There are a couple other things you should do,
as well! At least, if you want to get paid.

- **Submit your tax and KYC information.** This should be done by signing up on
  the [Stellar Quest website](https://quest.stellar.org). I know it feels like a
  hassle, but SQ Bounties can be lucrative and SDF needs to make sure all our
  ducks are in a row.

- **Join our Discord.** It's the friendliest community in crypto! If you want to
  do some code reviews around here, we do need to know a bit about you, and have
  some interactions with you. So, come on by and get to know us on the official
  [Stellar Quest discord server](https://discord.gg/jDjSQvTHTC)
